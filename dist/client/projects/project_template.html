    <!-- the idea is to use the alpine.js store function to save the state of which project the user wants,
        
    from there we take them to the same template page, but since we know the name of the project, and the year, we can read through the csv, find the data that matches, then parse into the template and create a unique page for every project, even though it is technically the same page-->


    <!--it is also possible that instead, we make a "template" page, and from there, we create custom web pages for every project, this is obviously the more tedious option, but it allows us to create some really independent sites for each proj-->
